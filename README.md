# SRM-Medical-Store-Management-System
The SRM Medical Store Management System project report contains the important methods and details in creating the project. The most important of which is to centralize the data administration and accessibility. The ADMIN will be able to input, maintain and access the medicine details, customer details, and about billings data more simply. The customers can have an overview about the medicine before purchasing. The pharmacy management system serves many purposes, including the safe and effective dispensing of pharmaceutical drugs. During the dispensing process, the system will prompt the pharmacist to verify the medication they have filled is for the correct patient, contains the right quantity and dosage, and displays accurate information on the prescription label. Advanced pharmacy management systems offer clinical decision support and may be configured to alert the pharmacist to perform clinical interventions, such as an opportunity to offer verbal counseling if the patient's prescription requires additional education in the pharmacy.
Medical Store management systems should also serve the pharmacist throughout the Pharmacistsâ€™ Patient Care Process.
